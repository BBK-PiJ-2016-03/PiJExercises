/*5  Rectangle
Write a program that reads the X and Y coordinates of two points an
d then outputs the area of a rectangle where
both points are opposite corners. Use the following class to store t
he data for the points:
class Rectangle {
Point upLeft;
Point downRight;
}
Your program should calculate (and write on the screen) the perime
ter and area of the rectangle.
Note: For exercises 5, 6, and 7 you must access (i.e. read or write)
the value of the coordinates of the points
through the rectangle, not directly through the point, i.e.
myRectangle.upLeft.x , not point.x or x. */




class Rectangle {
    Point upLeft;
    Point downRight;
}
